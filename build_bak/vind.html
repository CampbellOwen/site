Collectors represent their collection in the app to keep track of the price, expiration, and count of each bottle. Without handling a single bottle, they can search their collection for the details of a wine, know which wines are in their peak or need to be quarter-turned, and browse the history of their wine collection.</p></div><div class="card-item"><h5>Context</h5><p>Completed as a student project for SFU’s School of Interactive Arts and Technology with two other design students.

His true interest in wine began in University when he took a Wine Science course, and learned to experience and analyze each sip.</p><p>He enjoys the meditative aspect of practicing deep awareness and appreciation, as well as the culture and refined aesthetic afforded by this interest. He is often gifted wines by friends and family, and visits vineyards with his wife on holidays, usually departing with a case in tow.</p><p>Zameel would love to select a bottle quickly while he lets dinner simmer, without having to risk handling and disrupting each bottle until he finds a suitable pairing. He struggles with keeping track of expiration dates and has found himself terribly dissapointed when he left a bottle to age too long and it turned to vinegar. When selecting a wine, he might have a specific grape or price range in mind, depending on the occasion. When contemplating purchasing wine, he would like to know whether he has previously enjoyed that wine, how many similar wines he already has, and whether the price point is comparable to previous purchases of similar vintages.</p></div></div></div><div id="ideate"><div class="lemon"><h2>Ideate</h2></div><div class="info-card"><h5>Themes</h5><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Collection Organizer</p><ul><li>Represent adding and removing wines</li><li>Provide storage guidelines</li><li>Improve wine searchability</li><li>Provide historical record of collection</li><li>Encourage documentation of tasting notes for wines</li></ul></div><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Social Rating and Recommendations</p><ul><li>Share tasting notes with Vind community</li><li>Search and browse community reivews to see how they reviewed wines</li><li>Scan wine label to search</li><li>Community-sourced pairing recommendations</li><li>Wine education through resource sharing</li><li>“Watch” a wine to be notified when ratings are released for a vintage of interest</li><li>Earn points to increase user review credibility by sharing tasting notes that others find helpful</li></ul></div><div class="list-chunk"><p class="caption">Wine Reminders</p><ul><li>Specific wine releases from vineyards</li><li>Rating releases from notable wine contests and festivals</li><li>When to open vintages (reaching and leaving ideal aging for most rich tasting experience)</li><li>When to re-stock wines</li><li>Quarter-turn notification (to prevent oxidization)</li></ul></div></div><div class="info-card"><h5 class="lemon">Sketches</h5><p class="caption">*Sample from all sketches</p><div class="sketch-chunk"><h5>01</h5><img src=""><p class="caption lemon">Collection/Homescreen - 01</p><p>This version of the Collection / Homescreen organizes wines into categories in anticipation of various user goals, including seeking wines that were recently added, seeking a specific varietal, viewing wines within a certain price range, and selecting from wines within their ideal drinking age.</p></div><div class="sketch-chunk"><h5>02</h5><img src=""><p class="caption lemon">Collection/Homescreen - 02</p><p>This version lends to consideration of each varietal, as they are presented one at a time and can be swiped through.
